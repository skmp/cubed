					Tax and Fee Policy as of 23 October 2023
					GreenArrays, Inc.
					GreenArrays is not in the business of collecting taxes, tariffs, or any other fees for any governments that
					deny our company representation but would like us to expend unreimbursed labor and expenses for their
					benefit. The number of tax collecting entities in the world is greater than any small business is capable of
					keeping up with; in order to spend our energies on the purposes for which our business exists, we have at
					this time no other choice than to set policies that minimize our effort in complying with laws as they
					become applicable to us, and to ignore inapplicable laws. This is especially important because these
					governments are continually trying to, and sometimes succeeding at, broadening the scope of their
					authority to compel tax collections by businesses that have nothing to do with them. Here, then, are our
					policies as of the date shown above.
					Sales to our Local Area(s)
					We presently have bona fide business presence, maintain offices, and do business in the City of
					Cheyenne, Laramie County, State of Wyoming, in the United States of America.
					We will collect Sales Tax on products delivered anywhere in Wyoming at the same rate payable by our
					company in Cheyenne. Wyoming does not tax shipping &amp; handling.
					Sales to Other States
					At present, only one State (California) has compelled our company to collect its sales taxes, by
					threatening to prosecute our officers and directors who live in that state with misdemeanor crimes. As a
					result we collect California taxes on products delivered anywhere in California. Unfortunately, each city in
					California may have a different sales tax rate. Therefore, you will be charged sales tax at the current
					maximum rate of California cities. California taxes shipping &amp; handling as well as product. UPDATE of
					23 Oct 2023: The relatively new business nexus rules in California presently excuse us from collecting
					sales tax in that State.
					For products delivered anywhere else in the US, you are responsible for paying any sales/use tax or
					equivalent as may be required by the State in which you receive delivery.
					Sales to Other Countries
					Taxes and fees, such as EU Value Added Tax and/or Tariffs, are charged against our chips and other
					products by many countries. We take no responsibility whatsoever for calculating, collecting, or paying
					these taxes and fees, nor for enforcing your payment of them, other than to use shipping methods that
					purport to require you to pay them before taking delivery of our products.
					What if we collect tax at a higher rate than actually applies to you?
					As is the case in California, we collect the maximum rate in the state, because there is presently no
					practical way to adjust to your local tax rate at the time of sale. If the rate charged to you is greater than
					the rate actually applicable to you, any remainder will remain with GreenArrays as a partial
					reimbursement for our labor and other costs in collecting and paying sales tax on shipments into your
					State.
