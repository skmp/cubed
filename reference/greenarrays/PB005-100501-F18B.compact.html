					OVERVIEW
					The F18B is an evolutionary improvement of the F18A, offering higher speed and
					shorter code. The computer is small; eight fit in roughly a square millimeter. Depending
					on chip configurations, this yields between 100,000 and 200,000 computers per 8 inch
					wafer, contributing to the low cost of our chips.
					FEATURES
					 Small size, low cost
					 Fast, low energy design consumes only
					as much energy as is needed to do the
					programmed work. There is no cost per
					MIP, only per unit work
					 Self-contained memory and stacks
					 Port and pin wakeup
					 Simple, compact instruction set
					 Memory size balanced for high speed
					 Customizable ROM
					 Executable communication ports
					 Multiport operations &amp; port execution
					FAST, LOW-ENERGY DESIGN: Our ruthless commitment to simplicity is reinforced by
					design tools that force our engineers to confront and deal with the speed and energy
					costs of each design feature at every stage of the layout and simulation process. We
					continually strive to minimize internal loading and circuitry, always willing to reinvent
					not only inefficient conventional designs, but also any part of our own. The F18B is an
					unclocked, fully asynchronous computer which can execute basic instructions in 1.4
					nanoseconds without instruction fetches, and sustained rates of 1.6 nanoseconds
					when instruction words are fetched inline from RAM, with Vdd at 1.8V. The energy
					required to execute a basic instruction is on the order of 7 picojoules (pJ).
					SELF CONTAINED MEMORY AND STACKS: Each F18B contains 128 words of memory
					(up to 512 instructions) plus 20 words of stacks and registers; no memory bottlenecks.
					18-bit registers are S and T, the top two elements of the data stack; R, the top element
					of the return stack; and A, a read/write register. Address register B has 8 bits, and the
					program counter P has 10. Bit P8 is not used at present.
					IMPROVEMENTS in F18B
					 Faster instructions
					 Faster memory and port operations
					 New addressing scheme allows slot 1
					instructions to reach all destinations
					 Read of pin returns an instruction
					 Additional improvements in I/O
					PORT AND PIN WAKEUP: An F18B suspends execution in mid-instruction, using only
					leakage (100 nW) when waiting to move data to or from another computer or when
					waiting for a pin to change state. Suspension and resumption take no time or energy.
					INSTRUCTION SET: An 18-bit word is subdivided into four slots, each of which may
					contain a five-bit operation code (only codes banded in green may be used in slot 3):
					APPLICATIONS
					SLOT 0
					SLOT 1
					SLOT 2
					5
					SLOT 3
					1
					 Software defined I/O controllers
					 Simple MAC and PHY components
					 Node groups control complex devices
					such as SDRAM or implement complex
					algorithms such as cryptography
					 Networks of nodes cooperating to
					perform parallel and/or pipelined data
					or signal processing
					 Networks of nodes cooperating to
					simulate analog function blocks for
					control or DSP applications
					 Simulation, singly or in networks
					 Interpretation of higher level languages
					for applications or parts of applications
					where bulk is justified

					Add (+) becomes add with carry when bit 9 of program counter P is set. The
					destinations of jump, next and call in slots 0, 1, or 2 are combinations of existing P value
					with the bits (13, 8, or 3 ) in the remaining slots of the instruction word; all memory and
					all ports are accessible with slot 0 or 1 operations.

					Each node has its own:
					RAM and ROM
					Return Stack
					Data Stack
					ADDRESS MAP: Memory and registers are addressed with eight bits in the F18B,
					Local RAM (64x18) and ROM (64x18)
					according to the map shown here. When auto
					incrementing reads or writes are done using P
					(instruction fetch @p !p) or A (@+ !+), incremen-
					tation of an address in RAM wraps to zero after
					Start End Address Space
					00
					40
					80
					3F RAM, 64 words
					7F ROM, 64 words
					FF I/O ports and registers
					I/O logic option for edge nodes
					Comm Ports (2, 3, 4 or 5)
					IO Control &amp; Status Register
					Return Stack (8x18)
					03F; of an address in ROM wraps to 040 after 07F; and addresses in the I/O port and
					register area are not incremented at all. Address decoding in the latter area has a
					value for the register io (see F18B I/O documentation), for each of five
					communication ports (one of which may refer to an I/O pin or special register), and
					for all possible combinations of those five ports as well as a bit to allow reading or
					writing a special I/O register without waiting for pin wakeup.
					EXTENDED PRECISION INSTRUCTION: When executing code with bit 9 of P set to 1,
					the add instruction is interpreted as add with carry. In this case, and only in this
					case, a latched carry bit is added to the low order bit of the sum, and the carry out
					of the 18-bit ALU is latched at the end of the operation. The latch is neither used
					nor changed while P9 is zero. P9 has no effect on addressing as such.
					R
					Decrementer
					ROM CONTENTS: Each F18B can be built with unique ROM contents, and code
					written for a particular GA part may use routines in ROM to conserve RAM space.
					We are able to build customers’ application code into ROM for purposes such as
					creation of ASICs or barriers to competition.
					P (10)
					Incrementer (6)
					COMMUNICATION PORTS: Data move between nodes across these 18-bit parallel
					ports. Handshaking is automatic, requiring no code and little time. When one node
					is writing a given port at the same time as the other node sharing that port is
					reading it, data move between the nodes. Until that occurs, the node which reads
					or writes first is suspended until the other writes or reads to satisfy the operation.
					A
					B (8)
					I
					Slot Mux
					T
					MULTIPORT OPERATIONS: Each port is addressed by a single bit. These can be
					combined in an address to read or write on multiple ports in a single operation.
					When the desired operation is satisfied by another node sharing any of the selected
					ports, the operation completes. Among many other things, this facilitates efficiently
					spreading a serial data stream among multiple paths in an array of nodes
					programmed for parallel, pipelined processing.
					ALU
					S
					PORT EXECUTION: A definitive feature of the GreenArrays architecture is the ability
					of a computer to directly execute instructions “fed” to it via a communication port,
					with profound positive results on chip capability and communication efficiency. In
					the F18B, an I/O pin may be called and when it wakes up an instruction @b ; . . is
					returned for execution. For communication, there is no need to decode or parse a
					message when the message itself may be directly executed. This saves space, time,
					and energy. A node may use the resources of a neighbor without requiring any
					code in its memory; thus for example a neighbor may be used as a 64 word RAM
					resource. Interactive debugging may be done without using devoting any space in
					RAM or ROM to support that capability.
