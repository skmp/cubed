					OVERVIEW
					FEATURES
					The F18B computer’s I/O repertoire consists of four classes of pins with peripheral
					circuitry: General Purpose programmable digital I/O, Analog I/O, 18-bit parallel buses,
					and a high speed serializer/deserializer (SERDES). Chips may be created with any
					practical combination of these classes connected to selected edge nodes; the actual
					functions of the pins are defined by software running in the nodes.
					 Software Defined I/O
					 High impedance (&lt;3pF, &gt;200MΩ) inputs
					 Low power outputs
					 ESD protection 10KV HBM
					 Single io control and status register
					 General purpose digital I/O pins
					 Pin wakeup returning an instruction
					 Analog Input and Output
					 High speed SERDES
					I/O PINS IN GENERAL: When used for input, our pins are designed to represent high-
					impedance loads with little capacitance. For output, we design for driving small,
					capacitive loads, to minimize I/O energy consumption. Some pins are capable of higher
					power modes of operation. Each pin has ESD protection diodes which begin conducting
					(.1µA) when the voltage at a pin reaches Vdd+160mV or Vss-100mV. TLP testing of
					prototype chips indicates Human Body Model ESD protection on the order of 10KV.
					 18-bit Parallel Bus
					IMPROVEMENTS in F18B
					THE IO REGISTER: An 18-bit control and status register, named io and diagrammed
					below, is each F18B’s interface with its I/O circuitry (if any) and comm port handshake
					lines. In the “READ” line of the table below, the green background indicates signals that,
					if they exist, come from other nodes or the world outside. If not, they are treated like
					 Smoother DAC with optional load
					 ADC multiplexor can select DAC pin for
					calibration or as a second input
					 HBM ESD protection increased
					 New pin wakeup polarity management
					shortens and simplifies code
					 Reading a pin returns an instruction,
					shortening and simplifying code.

					APPLICATIONS

					 Simple digital input and output points
					 Simple communications PHY such as
					the blank bits and simply read the inverse of the last value written to that bit position in
					io . Read bit Rr- means right port read handshake when 0; Rw means right port write
					when 1. The adjacent bit pairs apply to the down , left , and up ports. Side nodes lack
					left , while top and bottom row nodes lack up comm ports. The writable bits of io are
					initialized, on reset, as though the value shown in the “reset” line had been written into
					the register. The values shown in “WRITE” pertain to general purpose digital I/O pins, if
					any; the values in “Alt write” are defined by specific peripherals.

					pin of this type. State is set by writing a value into the two control bits for a pin. All pins

					present voltage on the pin, 1 if high, regardless of the
					selected pin state; the computer is fast enough to
					directly observe the effects of RLC load circuits.

					PIN WAKEUP: When a side node reads its left port address, or a top/bottom node its
					up , the read is suspended while the pin state is the same as it was the last time io was
					read. The data from the read is an instruction word @b ; . . The pin may be included in
					any multiport read or execute operation.

					ANALOG INPUT: The F18B analog to digital converter
					(ADC) is a high speed, free running counter that can be
					read as up or left using a special protocol. Its count
					down frequency varies between 3.6GHz for Vdd input
					and 5.7GHz for Vss, as shown in the typical transfer
					function at right. The vco ctl field of io selects mode
					as below, with counter disabled on reset to save power.

					ANALOG OUTPUT: The digital to analog converter (DAC) is a programmable current
					source that can be used to generate a voltage across a resistance
					to ground, or to source an op-amp. By writing the xor of a
					desired value and hex 155 into the low nine bits of io that value
					controls the DAC output. The value 1FF (written as 0AA) sets the
					DAC for maximum current; a value of 0 (written as 155, the reset
					state) sets minimum current, high impedance output. The
					typical DAC transfer functions, in mV versus DAC values, into 75,
					50, 37.5 and 8 Ohms are shown at right; as the resistance
					decreases, the voltage decreases and the function becomes
					more linear. The S-shaped transfer function is loaded by the internal termination
					transistor (bit T in io zero).

					SERDES AND PARALLEL BUS have not been laid out or prototyped yet for F18B. The
					following descriptions for F18A may be changed upon implementation.
					Analog I/O Peripherals
					SERDES: The serializer/deserializer peripheral is a high speed (450 Mbit/second) transceiver
					for 18-bit frames using a half duplex two wire medium (clock and data). On reset the SERDES
					is in input mode. Writing 1 to bit SR in io sets transmit mode. When in transmit mode,
					writing a word to up is suspended until the previous word has been sent and then begins
					transmission of the new word. The clock stops if there are no data to transmit. When in
					receive mode, reading up is suspended until data are available. By jumping to up a node
					can execute code received via the SERDES. Additional rules apply for initializing the SERDES
					and for management of T and S.

					18-BIT PARALLEL BUS: This peripheral consists of an 18-bit read/write register addressed as
					up or left such that each bit corresponds to an I/O pin. The DB bit in io controls bus
					direction: 1, its reset state, for output; 0 is tristate (high impedance) input. Unlike general
					purpose pins, reading the port in output mode gives no useful information. A node with this
					peripheral usually has at least one GPIO pin, or a phantom equivalent, for timing
					synchronization. In this case, operations on the up port wait for pin wakeup while data
					Vss
					Protection diodes are useful
					in an RS232 signal receiver
					operates immediately regardless of pin state.
