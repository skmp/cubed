					AN0214 Getting Started with Eval Board EVB002
					1. Initial Check-Out
					This section outlines procedures for inspecting a board and verifying its configuration and function. These procedures
					are very similar to those we follow in the factory before shipping boards to you.
					1.1 Recommended Working Area
					Since the purpose of this board is to provide you with
					direct access to the very sensitive pins of your chips, you
					should set up a working area to protect the chips against
					Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) from your body. We
					recommend, as a basic precaution, that you use an anti-
					static mat connected to a single-point earth ground in
					common with any other equipment in use, and that you
					wear a wrist strap, as shown in the adjacent photo, while
					handling or probing the board. It is always a good idea to
					avoid wearing clothing that tends to accumulate static
					charges, and to touch the mat or a grounded part of the
					board when approaching the work area and before
					touching other parts of the board. Note that the metal
					shield of the SD card slot is a good ground for this purpose;
					the shields of the USB connectors are not grounded.
					If you have any questions about correct procedures, please check our website or contact the hotline for more
					information
					1.2 Factory Default Jumper Settings
					Begin by setting all jumpers to the default settings as we shipped the board to you. Please refer to this illustration and
					to the detailed information that follows:

					1.3 Check the Power Supply
					In the factory, we check the power supply before applying DC
					power to most of the board. Begin by removing all of the
					power select jumpers J10, J11, J14, J15 and J16 as shown here.
					Connect a voltmeter as shown; all four pins of header J29, near
					the Target chip, are ground and pin 3 (right side) of any of the
					power select headers is connected to the output of the on-
					board switching regulator.
					After setting the board up in this way, provide input power to the regulator, using either a "wall-wart" in J2, or any of
					the three USB connections J3, J9 or J18. Your voltmeter should indicate very nearly 1.8 volts. We do not recommend
					<div>checking resistance between V<sub>DD </sub>and ground on this board, because many meters apply high voltages exceeding some </div>
					chips' limits. When the checks are complete, re-insert the power select jumpers.
					If you use a "wall-wart" power source, it needs to provide 3.6 to 19.5V (5.0V if you will use J41 to power the Ethenet
					interface) on a type "N" connector, positive voltage on center pin. If the supply can produce 4.5 to 5 watts then it
					should be able to power the 80% efficient switching regulator at its maximum rated output of 2A at 1.8v.

					1.4 Identify and Set-up COM Ports for USB A, B, C
					Each USB connector identified as A, B, and C reading left to right goes to an FTDI USB to serial adaptor chip. These have
					unique serial numbers for the benefit of systems that use them to assign a permanent COM port number to each
					device. If using Windows or Parallels, attach the cables one at a time, identify the COM port numbers assigned using
					Device Manager, and find Advanced Port Settings. Change Latency Timer from default 16 ms to 1 ms, and change USB
					Transfer Sizes from default 4096 to 128 bytes. These settings will greatly improve performance. Subsequently each
					port may be used at any baud rate from 19,200 to 921,600. Turn off Serial Enumerator; turn on Set RTS On Close and
					Disable Modem Ctrl At Startup. See the arrayForth-3 User's Manual installation sections for more information and for
					other platforms. You must keep track of which COM port numbers connect to which of the board's USB ports.
					1.5 Simple Confidence Test using polyForth
					Connect any serial terminal emulator program such as PuTTY or HyperTerm to USB port B, 8 data bits, no parity, one
					stop bit and no flow control. Remove NO-BOOT jumper J26 and press the host chip reset button (C0-RST) on the lower
					left corner of the board, then hit the space bar on the terminal to auto-baud polyForth. You should see:
					pF/G144.03b1 12/21/18 (or whichever version is in flash)
					hi _
					Hit the enter key. You should see another ok which indicates that a great deal of the board is working. Please contact
					us right away if you do not see these things!
					1.6 Test GA144 Chips using arrayForth 3
					To completely self-test the chips, download DB013 arrayForth 3 User's Manual and the current aF3 Windows Installer
					<div>from our website (see <a href="#5_3">3.2 below).</a><a href="#5_3"> </a>Follow instructions in the User's Manual for your host platform to install the </div>
					arrayForth-3 software and identify and configure your COM ports. You do not need to edit the arrayForth code at this
					point but you do need to get the COM ports identified and the connections to USB ports A and C configured as
					instructed for your platform.
					With USB ports A and C connected to the EVB002, and with NO-BOOT jumper J26 installed, run saneForth on your PC or
					other platform as per instructions for your platform. Type the following phrases to run self-tests, substituting the
					actual COM port for USB A (host IDE) for 10 and the port for USB C (target IDE) for 12:
					10 SELFTEST (runs factory tests on host chip)
					12 SELFTEST (runs factory tests on target chip)
					10 AUTOTEST (tests target chip under host chip control using synchronous boot,
					and tests SERDES between the chips)
					Hit ENTER at the end of each of the above
					phrases. While a test is running you will see a
					screen like the one shown here. The "Test
					Progress" is initially busy in white on blue, and
					while the test is running the numbers on the
					third line are updated as the testing progresses.
					When the testing is completed successfully, you
					will see the "Ok! " advisory in black on green. If
					there is a failure, it will instead display "FAIL!"
					in black on magenta.
					Please contact us right away if you do not see the expected results or if you have any difficulty in running these tests!

					2. Move On to Programming
					Now that you've verified the integrity of your board and its connections with a host machine, it's time to take a closer
					look at the two main development tools used in programming our chips.
					•
					arrayForth-3 (aF-3) is a full blown, self -reproducing professional operating system suite for IA32 PC
					platforms (saneFORTH) and for the GA144 running in a Virtual Machine of several nodes (polyFORTH).
					Many of our software development tools run in both environments, although some (like Softsim) are only
					practical on the PC while others (like the internal IDE) are only feasible running inside the chip itself. Mass
					storage is provided by the PC (serial disk) and by the EVB002 (16 MB SPI Flash). All software supported by
					Greenarrays has been developed and is maintained using aF-3.
					aF-3 runs on both saneForth (PC platform) and polyForth (on the EVB002). Some of the tools are only
					implemented on one of the platforms, by intention. Two tools, "softsim" and the external IDE based flash
					burner, are not yet supported by aF-3.
					•
					•
					eForth is a very simple and portable implementation of ANS Forth. This particular implementation runs
					on a 16-bit Virtual Machine that runs on our chips. eForth requires only a terminal emulator on USB port
					B, although the supplied emulator provides additional useful capabilities. It's not supported by
					GreenArrays but source code is available and it may be supported by individuals.
					Third Party Tools have been developed by at least two users of our chips. See our website,
					Documentation &amp; Software, for more information about these tools.
					Please see our website for to download these tools, their documentation, and other relevant code, documentation and
					application notes.
					3. Resources and Details
					3.1 What's in the Box
					In addition to the Eval Board itself, there is an antistatic bag containing parts you may find useful. The exact
					composition of this bag is subject to change, but as of the time of this writing it contains the following items: One Dual
					voltage, 1 or 2 GB MMC card intended for use as primary mass storage by polyFORTH when MMC is supported. One
					USB cable. Two Clip-leads. One long jumper wire for Ethernet transmitter power. One each DB9, VGA, and USB-B
					sockets. Three TRS audio jacks. Long single and double row male headers that may be cut up and soldered where
					needed. Five LEDs and five 47Ω resistors for diagnostic and general use.
