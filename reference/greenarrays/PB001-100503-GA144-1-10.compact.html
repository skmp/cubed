					OVERVIEW
					FEATURES
					This very powerful and versatile chip consists of an 18x8 array of architecturally
					identical, independent, complete F18A computers, or nodes, each of which operates
					asynchronously. Each computer is capable of performing a basic ALU instruction in 1.5
					nanoseconds for an energy cost on the order of 7 picojoules. Nothing else available
					today comes close to that winning combination. Twenty-two of the computers on the
					edges of the array have one or more I/O pins and one of several classes of circuitry
					associated with them, as illustrated below.
					 144 independent F18A computers
					 Suitable for inexpensive, 4-layer PCBs
					 Up to 96 billion operations per second
					 Instantaneous power ranges from 14
					microwatts to 650 milliwatts.
					 Energy consumed depends on each
					computer’s duty cycle, controlled by
					software and events, with granularity in
					picoseconds
					 Negligible time and energy expended
					starting and stopping each node
					 Suspended nodes respond to internal
					events in picoseconds and external
					events in nanoseconds
					 High impedance (&lt;3pF, &gt;200MΩ) inputs
					 Five analog inputs and five outputs
					 Two 18-bit parallel interfaces
					 25 programmable digital I/O pins
					 Overall digital I/O bandwidth can
					exceed 3 gigabits per second with
					software “bit banging”, plus an
					additional 800 megabits per second
					when both SERDES are operating
					 Bootable via SPI or any of four serial
					protocols; custom ROM available
					 9216 words RAM and same of ROM
					distributed among all nodes (equivalent
					of 41472 total bytes)
					 Minimal external components needed
					to build a working system
					Nodes numbered in green have one or two GPIO pins. Those in blue have analog I/O.
					Those in orange have digital I/O with specialized purposes: 001 and 701 have high
					speed SERDES; 705 has four pins which may be used for an SPI bus; 217, 517 and 715
					have a GPIO pin whose read line is connected to one or more analog nodes for sample
					synchronization; and nodes 007, 8, and 9 together control two 18-bit parallel buses and
					four GPIO pins that may be used to control external memory chips. These and the SPI
					bus are of course available for other uses if desired.
					APPLICATIONS
					 Energy harvesting applications
					 Portable devices
					 Remote sensing and data reduction
					 Ideal for parallel and/or pipelined work
					 Image processing
					 Complex control systems
					 Cryptography
					 High speed signal processing
					 Simulation and synthesis
					 Inexpensive, massively parallel systems
					for research and education
					All nodes are suspended after reset, prepared to execute instructions coming from any
					neighbor node via a comm port. Six of these are also waiting for incoming signals on
					their pin(s) which will be interpreted as boot frames. 001 and 701 SERDES will execute
					instructions received; 200 listens for high speed 1-wire protocol, 300 for 2-wire synch,
					708 for RS232 framed async, and 705 can boot from an SPI flash memory device.
					When product requirements for responsiveness, computing power and energy
					limitations collide, this superb chip is the ideal prototyping and initial product platform.
					As a product matures, GreenArrays can and will configure custom chips to further
					minimize cost and energy consumption for its customers.
					 Artificial intelligence, neural nets

					SUITABILITY: The GA144 is designed to support the largest and most demanding
					computing challenges that can be addressed with a modest sized die in a relatively
					inexpensive and easy to use package while still using well less than 650 mW in most
					practical applications. The geometry allows for generous numbers of parallel paths
					and/or pipeline stages, or for complex flowgraphs in control, simulation, or DSP
					applications. Clusters of nodes devoted to functions such as cryptographic
					algorithms are easily placed in the large array, and the cluster needed to control
					external memory and run a high level language from it is well out of the way but has
					good surface area for interaction with other functions. Use it also as a universal
					protoytping platform for applications destined to run on our smaller chips.

					SOFTWARE SUPPORT: A complete arrayForth™ software development platform is
					available free of charge on our website. Included are a compiler for machine code,
					an interactive simulator and an interactive development and debugging
					environment. Complete source language is provided so that all components of this
					platform are extensible by the user.

					Direct control of SDRAM or
					SRAM without “glue” parts
					When large, high-level programs are required, the GA144 supports eForth running
					from external SRAM or SDRAM. Typically, three to five nodes control the external
					memory and two nodes interpret the higher-level language.
					PACKAGE: The GA144 is available in a 10x10mm, 88-pin QFN with 0.4mm pin pitch.
					All ground connections are made to the central Die Attach Paddle.
